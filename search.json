    "title": "An enhancing of reo magareva (Mangarevan, language from French Polynesia): The project of « bilingual teaching French-Mangarevan » (for cycles 1, 2 and 3)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The reo magareva is the vernacular language of the Mangareva (or Gambier) archipelago and is notably an overseas regional language after Tahitian in French Polynesia. French is the official language. According to the latest studies, the reo magareva is a “severely endangered” language (Ena Manuireva ; 2015). Nowadays, the Ministry of Education has decided to set up a bilingual French-Mangarevan teaching system with equal hours at the Maputeoa elementary school from the beginning of the school year in August 2021 (cycle 1 only) in an effort to raise awareness of the heritage, decentralize the frameworks and give priority to the academic success of the pupils. Today, since August 2022, the unanimous choice of the teaching staff is to extend the scheme to the three levels: cycles 1 (kindergarten), 2 (1st-3rd grade) and 3 (4th-6th grade).\nThe results of this thesis will enable us to understand the sociolinguistic changes that have occurred since the emergence of the project. The latter influences teachers, children, parents and inhabitants, in other words the whole linguistic community of the archipelago. At on social level, the system is creating a stream of consciousness within families. The relatives want to learn; some learn new words, some are against the neologisms of the school… We will analyze their feelings and actions towards the project. Then, on the linguistic level, we will observe the oxymoronic creation between the enhancing of old words and the creation of new terms by the agent. The transmission of these lexicons among the pupils is also the object of our study within and outside the school when the community is deprived of an academy. We will extract the results of this research from the semi-structured interviews. This work will allow us to account for the various ways in which reo magareva is valued through the project."

    "title": "Rethinking Indonesian-type passives: Lessons from Javanese",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Austronesian languages known as the Indonesian-type are traditionally considered split ergative languages wherein the Austronesian-type active-undergoer voice contrast co-occurs with Indo-European-style passive voice. In this presentation we demonstrate instead that one of these languages—Javanese—is not as typologically unusual as previously thought. Previously overlooked aspects of Javanese syntax show that the language is best viewed as exhibiting a run-of-the-mill accusative case system wherein the so-called “active vs. object voice alternation” indexes subject vs. nonsubject topicalization. We then present independent evidence that Javanese’s so-called “passive construction” is essentially an object voice construction that contains a third-person subject/initiator. Accordingly, Javanese does not exhibit an Indo-European-type passive, contra previous views. We conclude that Javanese exhibits a reduced Philippine-style voice system where voice alternation is an Ā-phenomenon associated with topicalization and not argument structure alternation, similar to the “voice” system of Tagalog (Shibatani 1988; Richards 2000; Chen 2017), Malagasy (Pearson 2005), and Puyuma (Chen 2017) and the Nilotic languages Dinka (van Urk 2015) and Kurmuk (Anderson 2015).\nThis new analysis of Javanese voice has important broader implications for our understanding of the syntactic typology of voice. Not only does it reveal a new locus of variation within languages considered to have a “hybrid” voice system, but it also reveals previously unknown variation within a cline of constructions traditionally called the Indonesian-type passives, many of which have recently been shown to be structurally similar to Indo-European-type passives (e.g. Indonesian: Aldridge 2008; Acehese: Legate 2012, 2014)."

    "title": "The syntax of Hawaiian actor-emphatic constructions: A preliminary analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The actor-emphatic (AE) construction is widely attested in East Polynesian (EP) languages and has been seen as a feature characteristic of this sub-group (Clark 1976; Harlow 1986). Pragmatically, AE constructions explicitly draw attention to who or what did the action denoted by the verb, thus ʻfocusing’ the agent argument, and are a productive strategy for forming subject wh-questions. Despite their relative ubiquity in EP languages, however, AE constructions have only been studied in any detail for Māori (Bauer 2004; Clark 1976; Chung 1978; Pearce 1999; Waite 1990, and others) and Tahitian (Potsdam and Polinsky 2012). While the AE in Hawaiian is routinely presented in pedagogical materials for the language (Elbert and Pukui 1979; Hopkins 1992, and others), previous linguistic treatment is limited to an analysis using the Generative Case model in the doctoral work of Emily Hawkins (1979). In this talk, I report the morphosyntactic facts for Hawaiian AE, using data from TAM marking, interrogatives, reflexive binding, relativization, and topicalization to argue that Hawaiian actor-emphatics can be analyzed as a type of (pseudo-)cleft construction composed of a matrix predicate and a dependent clause. I will then compare these results to those reported for Maori and Tahitian and position them within a broader typology of wh-question formation in Polynesian."
